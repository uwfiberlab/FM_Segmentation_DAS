# Phase Picking - Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) Foundation Model (FM)
## Literature Review / Introduction:
**Read papers**
*DAS overview and current technology
* Current Phase picking models and slow speeds
* Goal to speed up process for this     
* state of the art

## Data
* for my section it will be the GCI Alaska data
* describe cable location, dates used for cable, how much data


## Methods:
* describe the pipeline for the model as well as the training utilized for the model

## Results
* undergo an evaluation of how the methods were utilized and how well it was able to segment out specific waves
* Focus of phase picking for segmentation - method perspection
* Can we improve picking performance and computing time with segmentation?"
